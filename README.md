# cLFV_GlobalBounds
This repository contains the global bounds and inverse correlation matrices needed to build the pseudo-$\chi^2$ that encodes the results of [REF] in the SMEFT scenario.

Global bounds and correlations are available for the following scenarios:
- $\tau-\ell$ operators involving all light quarks and with only first generation quarks
- $\tau-\ell$ operators involving only first generation quarks
- $\mu-e$ operators involving all light quarks after the inclusion of nuclear uncertainties
- $\mu-e$ operators involving only first generation quarks after the inclusion of nuclear uncertainties
